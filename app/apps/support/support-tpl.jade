        p YCL-fiber has developed a core base of technology in both components and modules. Based on fused biconic taper technology, we are capable of producing WDM, wide band coupler, and narrow band coupler. For micro-optics technology, Huashu started from elementary parts such as single fiber/dual fiber Pigtails and Collimators. We have also successful developed Isolators, and 3-port Add/Drop Filter devices for DWDM/CWDM/OADM. Currently, we are devoting ourselves to compact sized designs, and striving to meet high-end specifications with lower cost. For module technology, we have developed N x M optical splitter modules/EDFA module/multi-channel modules for DWDM/CWDM/OADM.
