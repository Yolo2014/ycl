        Every year YCL organizes entertainment trip for its employee’s recreation. This year YCL organized two days (15th and 16th December) trip to Shaoguan which is located on the Jingguang Railway about 221 KM north of the provincial capital of Guangzhou. Shaoguan is especially famous for Nanhua temple and Danxia mountain. First day, all employees of YCL visited Nanhua Temple which is called “the temple of South China”. This is a historical temple which was first built in A.D.502, more than 1,500 years ago. At evening all employees went to Danxia mountain for hot spring bath in natural hot mountain water. It was an amazing and wonderful experience to enjoy the indoor and outdoor hot spring with “hot ice flame”. End of the first day all get together in a networking dinner party to cheers each other.
